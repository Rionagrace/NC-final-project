Andesite Boulder	Archaeological Site	"Oxford Rd, Manchester, M13 9PL"	"53.4658, -2.2346"	"On a lawn in the University of Manchester’s Old Quadrangle, a great lump of lava stands proudly as an unusual decorative feature surrounded by the Quad’s grand ivy-covered Gothic architecture. Balanced on a stone plinth in front of the Beyer Building, the andesite boulder weighs over 20 tons and measures up at eight feet by nine feet by five feet. It’s understood to have made its way to the area from Borrowdale in the Lake District during the last Ice Age, around 20,000 years ago. Having journeyed over 80 miles, the well-traveled boulder remained at rest 28 feet below the surface for centuries. That is, until February 1888, when workers discovered the rock beneath the Oxford Road corridor while making excavations during the construction of new sewers. The rock has been on public display in its current position since the excavations. There in the Old Quad, which is often the scene of graduation ceremony celebrations, it stands as a fitting presence—something that traveled far and arrived in Manchester tens of thousands of years before students flocked to the place from all over the globe."

Castlesteads	Archaeological Site	"Burrs Country Park, Woodhill Rd, Bury, BL8 1DA"	53.612875 -2.306955	"Castlesteads is an Iron Age promontory hill fort on the east bank of the River Irwell. The site is defended by a 120 m (390 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) wide ditch, and a silted up channel of the river. Although there is no immediate access currently to the top of the site, there are good views of its steep slopes from Burrs Country Park. The hillside is now covered in trees, but you can get a sense of just how well defended this site was by walking around the bottom of it. The fort dates from the late Iron Age. It was occupied from the 5th Century BC and continued in use into the first and second century after the Roman invasion. Such places were constructed as defensive sites, but also were status pieces, radiating power out to the surrounding countryside. In the early days following the Roman invasion, Cartimandua, queen of the local tribe, the Brigantes, was a client ruler of the Romans, so it may well be that this was the reason it was not slighted (attacked) by them."

Mamucium	Archaeological Site	"Castlefield, Manchester"	"53.475455, -2.255209"	"Mamucium, also known as Mancunium, is a former Roman fort in the Castlefield area of Manchester in North West England. The castrum, which was founded c. AD 79 within the Roman province of Roman Britain, was garrisoned by a cohort of Roman auxiliaries near two major Roman roads running through the area. Several sizeable civilian settlements (or vicus) containing soldiers' families, merchants and industry developed outside the fort. The ruins were left undisturbed until Manchester expanded rapidly during the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century. Most of the fort was levelled to make way for new developments such as the construction of the Rochdale Canal and the Great Northern Railway. The site is now part of the Castlefield Urban Heritage Park that includes renovated warehouses. A section of the fort's wall along with its gatehouse, granaries, and other ancillary buildings from the vicus have been reconstructed and are open to the public."

A civilian settlement (vicus), made up of traders and hangers on of the soldiers, grew around the fort in the 2nd century. The fortlet was abandoned in the mid 120s when it was superseded by the neighbouring forts at Manchester and Slack. About the same time, the civilian settlement was abandoned. A series of ditches and earthworks was built to mark the site."	Roman	79	https://webbaviation.co.uk/aerial/_data/i/galleries/Lancashire/Oldham/CastleshawRomanFortgb00435-me.jpg	—

Baguley Hall	Building	"Hall Ln, Wythenshawe, Manchester, M23 1NP"	"53.395189, -2.278265"	"Situated on Hall Lane in Baguley, the hall was built in the 14th century for the de Baguley family. It’s one of the oldest surviving Timber Halls left in the United Kingdom. Interestingly, the construction of the house - designed around oversized planks - was believed to have connections with Danish Viking boat-building techniques. It is thought the hall was created as a manor house before being turned into a farmhouse. It has a medieval north wing remodeled in the 17th century; a 16th-century porch; and an early 17th-century south wing. The hall was owned by the de Baguley family - but later on came into the possession of the Legh family, who had the property for about 400 years. The final male heir of the home was Edward Legh. He married Eleanor, who was the daughter of William Tatton of Wythenshawe Hall. Together they had three daughters, who couldn’t inherit so at that point the house was leased to the Viscount Allen. In 1749 the estate was bought by one Joseph Jackson of Rostherne who's family had married into the Leghs.

Quarry Bank Mill was established by Samuel Greg, and was notable for innovations both in machinery and also in its approach to labour relations, the latter largely as a result of the work of Greg's wife, Hannah Lightbody. The family took a somewhat paternalistic attitude toward the workers, providing medical care for all and limited education to the children, but all laboured roughly 72 hours per week until 1847 when a new law shortened the hours. Greg also built housing for his workers, in a large community now known as Styal Estate. Some were conversions of farm houses, or older residences but 42 new cottages, including the Oak Cottages (now Grade II Listed), were built in the 1820s when the mill was being expanded.

In 1991 this was replaced with stone-clad reinforced concrete."
