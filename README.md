## **Getting Started**

### **Clone the Repo**
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone <repo-url> `

## **Supabase**

This project requires `PostGIS` extension. Entire setup and seeding is covered in migration files.

### **Create a Supabase Account**

1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2. Once you've signed up and logged in, create a new project by following the instructions in the Supabase dashboard.
3. After creating your project, you'll be provided with a `Project URL` and `Anon Key` which you will need to add to your `.env.local` file.

### **Set Up Environment Variables**

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root (if you don't have one already) 
2. Inside `.env.local`, insert the `Project URL` and `Anon Key` into file:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[PROJECT].supabase.co
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[ANON_KEY]
   ```
2. Run `npx supabase link` to link cloud account with CLI.
3. Run `npx supabase db push` to apply all migrations and set up database schema.
4. Run `npx supabase test db --linked` to verify that database schema is correct. 

### **Seed the Database (When No Issues)**
If everything is working and you want to seed the database with initial data (without needing to reset), you can use the following command:
`npx supabase db reset --linked`

This will reset the database and reapply all migrations, including seeding the data (this is the normal process to seed the database without any issues). You can skip the --no-seed flag because no special circumstances require it.


### **Supabase Cloud Reset (When There is an Issue)**

**WARNING:**
- Running the reset command will erase all data in your cloud database.
- To reset use this command:

Run `npx supabase db reset --linked`

### **Tests failing upon reset**

**REASON:** Database cannot be tested after seeding.

1. Run `npx supabase db reset --linked --no-seed`
2. Run `npx supabase test db --linked`
3. **Important**: Supabase CLI does not support on demand seeding at the time of writing this.
- Rerun the reset command without the `--no-seed` flag: `npx supabase db reset --linked`

This will re-seed your database and apply the necessary data.

## Install Dependencies

After setting up Supabase, install all the necessary dependencies by running:

`npm install`

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, including Expo.

## **Running the App**

After installing the dependencies, you can run the app on your device or emulator. For iOS, you will need to have **Xcode** installed, and for Android, you'll need **Android Studio**.

### **For iOS:**

1. Install **Xcode** from the Mac App Store (required for building and running iOS apps).
2. Once installed, run the following command to launch the app on the iOS simulator:

`npm run ios`

### **For Android:**

1. Install **Android Studio** from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) in Android Studio.
3. After setting up, run the following command to launch the app on the Android emulator:

`npm run android`


## Issues

### iOS: Mapbox not working

1. go to ios directory
2. run `pod install`
3. edit `[PROJECT]/ios/Pods/MapboxMaps/Sources/MapboxMaps/Annotations/ViewAnnotationManager.swift`

   1. replace following code

   ```swift
   public var annotations: [UIView: ViewAnnotationOptions] {
       idsByView.compactMapValues { [mapboxMap] id in
           try? mapboxMap.options(forViewAnnotationWithId: id)
       }
   }
   ```

   2. with

   ```swift
   public var annotations: [String: Optional<Any>] {
       var result: [String: Optional<Any>] = [:]

       for (view, options) in idsByView.compactMapValues({ [mapboxMap] id in try? mapboxMap.options(forViewAnnotationWithId: id) }) {
           let key = String(describing: view)
           result[key] = options
       }

       return result
   }
   ```

### iOS: Missing NSLocation\*UsageDescription

1. At `app.json` file add correct description into `expo.ios.infoPlist`
2. Run `npx expo prebuild --clean`
3. Run `npm run ios`
